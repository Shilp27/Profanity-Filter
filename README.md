SOAP is a profanity filter that not only censors curse words, it replaces them with funnier words. We have used HTML/CSS/Js to build a website that acts as a profanity filter. This could be later developed as an API to serve its purpose. 

While it can be a fun, light-hearted app used among friends, it can also be implemented into various other scenarios. Whether it be call centre employees that face derogatory language everyday, vile profanities used in video game chat rooms Son Of A Peach is the solution.

Utmost care would be taken so that nothing gets lost in translation or miscommunicated, as we store recordings in textual format for rechecking.

Please check out the video pitch: for details and the demonstration video to see how our application works.
